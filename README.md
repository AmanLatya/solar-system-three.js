# 3D Solar System Simulation using Three.js

A fully interactive 3D simulation of our solar system built with [Three.js]. It features realistic textures, orbiting planets, rotation, labeled objects, dynamic lighting, time control (pause/play/speed), and interactive GUI controls.

## Features

-  Realistic Sun with emissive material and label
-  8 textured planets with orbits and rings (Saturn, Uranus, Neptune)
-  Dynamic planetary motion (orbit + self-rotation)
-  Time control (pause, speed up, reverse time)
-  Interactive canvas with mouse hover & click-to-focus
-  Starfield background for deep space effect
-  lil-gui interface to control each planet's orbit/rotation speed
